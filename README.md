# bike_sharing

# Overview
The goal of this project is to convince the investor about our bike sharing program. We did this in a few different ways. Show the length of time that bikes are checked out for all riders and genders. Show the number of bike trips for all riders and genders for each hour of each day of the week. Finaly, show the number of bike trips for each type of user and gender for each day of the week. 

#Result


The image below shows us the checkout time by user. As you can see, most users ride the bikes 10 minutes or less.

This chart shows us that, on average, males ride more bikes and ride them for a longer period of time.

The heatmap tells us that the majority of rides happen between 5:00PM and 6:00PM
